# Create a new Repository

We define a repository as the instrument to use when we need to retrieve or persist data that exists in the domain. 

There are several choices of persistence technologies but we go down the fundamentals. The vast majority of the time we need to perform the basic four operations: create, retrieve, update, delete (CRUD). For which we provide interfaces equipped with these frequent operations.

## Implementing directly the interfaces

Although it's tempting to just implement the interfaces provided (and for simple cases that's probably it) we suggest to create your own Repository Interfaces that suit your needs.

We have divided the interfaces in two groups: read only and full repositories. Each of them come in two versions: synchronous and asynchronous. 

For more flexibility you can either implement the version with both generic parameters TKey and TEntity or just TEntity assuming TKey is int, which is a common scenario.

These are the available interfaces to implement:

* IReadOnlyRepository < TEntity > 
* IReadOnlyRepository < TKey, TEntity >
* IReadAsyncRepository < TEntity > 
* IReadAsyncRepository < TKey, TEntity >
* IRepository < TEntity >
* IRepository < TKey, TEntity >
* IAsyncRepository < TEntity >
* IAsyncRepository < TKey, TEntity >

### IReadOnlyRepository < TEntity >

This interface defines methods for retrieving data in various ways, here are the methods divided in two groups.

* IList < TEntity > All(); It should return all the items without any filtering.

* IList < TEntity > All(int page, int itemsPerPage); It should return a 'page' of the entire data set. *page* is usually implemented starting at 1 and *itemsPerPage* specify the number of items to retrieve.

* TEntity FindBy(TKey id); It should return only one instance of the entity given its unique identifier.

* int Count(); It should return the total amount of items in the data set.

### IReadAsyncRepository < TEntity >

* Task< List< TEntity > > AllAsync(); Async version of All(). It should return all the items without any filtering.

* Task < List < TEntity > > AllAsync(int page, int itemsPerPage); Async version of All(int page, int itemsPerPage). It should return a 'page' of the entire data set. *page* is usually implemented starting at 1 and *itemsPerPage* specify the number of items to retrieve.

* Task< TEntity > FindByAsync(TKey id); Async version of FindBy(TKey id). It should return only one instance of the entity given its unique identifier.

*  Task < int > CountAsync(); Async version of Count(). It should return the total amount of items in the data set.

### IRepository < TEntity >

This interface defines methods for persisting and altering the data in various ways, as well as all the other read only ones, here are the methods: 

* void Add(TEntity item); It should persist the given entity in the data store. Depending on the specific circumstance, duplicated unique identifiers need to be handled.

* void Add(IEnumerable< TEntity > items); It should persist a list of instances of the given entity, ideally using some form of batching mechanism to make it more efficiently. 

* void Update(TEntity item); It should replace all non-identity information of the given entity with the provided up to date data into the data store. 

* void Delete(TEntity item); It should remove the given instance of the entity from the data store. Depending on the specific circumstance, non-existent unique identifiers need to be handled.

* void Delete(TKey id); Normally only one of these Delete is fully implemented, the other one will only call it with the required information.

* void Delete(IEnumerable< TEntity > items); It should remove a list of instances of the given entity, ideally using some form of batching mechanism to make it more efficiently. 

> **Note:** - For all these methods, the general convention is to assume everything was successful unless an exception is thrown from either the implemented code or the data store itself. 

### IAsyncRepository < TEntity >

* Task Add(TEntity item); Async version of Add(TEntity item). It should persist the given entity in the data store. Depending on the specific circumstance, duplicated unique identifiers need to be handled.

* Task Add(IEnumerable < TEntity > items); Async version of the collection Add(). It should persist a list of instances of the given entity, ideally using some form of batching mechanism to make it more efficiently. 

* Task Update(TEntity item); Async version of Update(TEntity item). It should replace all non-identity information of the given entity with the provided up to date data into the data store.  

* Task Delete(TEntity item); Async version of Delete(TEntity item). It should remove the given instance of the entity from the data store. Depending on the specific circumstance, non-existent unique identifiers need to be handled.

* Task Delete(TKey id); Async version of Delete(TKey id). Normally only one of these Delete is fully implemented, the other one will only call it with the required information.

* Task Delete(IEnumerable< TEntity > items); Async version of Delete(IEnumerable< TEntity > items). It should remove a list of instances of the given entity, ideally using some form of batching mechanism to make it more efficiently. 


## Examples

In memory Person repository with all the operations, in this case the async implementations are just a copy of the sync ones. 

```csharp
ï»¿using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using DynamoCode.Infrastructure.Data;
using MyApp.Domain;

namespace MyApp.Infrastructure
{
    public class PersonInMemoryRepository : IRepository<Person>
    {
        private readonly IList<Person> data = new List<Person>();
        public PersonInMemoryRepository()
        {
            data.Add(new Person { Id = 1, FirstName = "P1", LastName = "LN1", Age = 30 });
            data.Add(new Person { Id = 2, FirstName = "P2", LastName = "LN2", Age = 31 });
            data.Add(new Person { Id = 3, FirstName = "P3", LastName = "LN3", Age = 32 });
            data.Add(new Person { Id = 4, FirstName = "P4", LastName = "LN4", Age = 33 });
            data.Add(new Person { Id = 5, FirstName = "P5", LastName = "LN5", Age = 34 });
        }

        public IList<Person> All()
        {
            return data;
        }

        public IList<Person> All(int page, int itemsPerPage)
        {
            if (page <= 0)
                page = 1;

            var items = data;

            if (itemsPerPage > 0)
            {
                items = data.Skip((page - 1) * itemsPerPage).Take(itemsPerPage).ToList();
            }
            return items;
        }

        public int Count()
        {
            return data.Count();
        }

        public Person FindBy(int id)
        {
            return data.First(x => x.Id == id);
        }

        public void Add(Person entity)
        {
            data.Add(entity);
        }

        public void Add(IEnumerable<Person> items)
        {
            foreach (var item in items)
            {
                data.Add(item);
            }
        }

        public void Delete(Person entity)
        {
            data.Remove(entity);
        }

        public void Delete(int id)
        {
            var item = FindBy(id);
            Delete(item);
        }

        public void Delete(IEnumerable<Person> entities)
        {
            foreach (var item in entities)
            {
                Delete(item);
            }
        }

        public void Update(Person entity)
        {
            Delete(entity);
            Add(entity);
        }

    }
